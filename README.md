Node Module for UserAuth in web apps
  This package uses the node infrastructure, for
  creating highly scalable network platforms.
   
  **Featuring certified SSL protection**
  
  - Applying the dynamic platform of, buffer-targeted elements,
  This vector can implement a variety of tools for interacting,
  with static objects.
  
  - Define the mathematical properties of each object in detail,
  sufficient for a reader to create a mental image. Yet sophisticated,
  enough to be accepted. 

#Usage

Install this globally and you'll have access to the <code>userAuth</code> command from any part of
your system.
 
 <code>npm install -g userAuth</code>
  
  This module uses a dynamic circular buffer system where there is,
  a set of accepted commands to the interpreter. These are standard,
  linux type commands.
  
  **Example**
  <code>userAuth [cmd(s)] [opt(s)] </code>
   
                  Commands:
  **GET Command**
  
  <code> get - The standard get request. Requires a HTTP(S) target </code>
            <code>(**e.x** userAuth get https://ha.ckme.com)</code> 
            
Key:
``` UNIX-bash
  GET
```

Key Value:
```UNIX-bash
String, List, Array
```

  **ls Command**
  <code>ls - List all files and folders within the current directory</code>.
  if None is specified.
            
  **SET Command**  
  
  ``` UNIX-bash
  SET - Set a variable, this can either be global or local
 ````
          This command can define any range of variables from programming
          implements, to Database variables. The Syntax is as follows:
        

  Key: 
  ``` UNIX-bash
  SET
  ````
  
  Key Value 
  ```UNIX-bash
  String, Integer
  ```
          
  When you have a specific global constant that needs to be set,
  a command can be formed in the format:
          
 <code>set VARIABLE=value</code>
 <code>(**e.x** userAuth set var=1)</code>
  
<<<<<<< Templates:
```ruby 
  for (each userauth(Module): ifExists) {
    if != Module.aspx.Definition();
      Module = [$MODULE_REF_LOG != USERAUTH_RUBY_VERSION '2.3'];
      FOR 
    }
```
###Cross-Platform
Use this to enable Linux functionality for userAuth, add one of the following to your
<code>~/.bashrc</code> or <code>~/.zshrc</code> file.

#### Mac OS/ iOS Ports
Development has begun on an iOS oriented port of this application. Release dates of 
Ma, Unix, windows ports will be synchronous.

      **Notable Features in Mac Version**
- Each individual function of Mac OS differs from each individual of Windows and Linux      

 
  (~~Apply cryptographic method of encryption accross all user data types~~)
  - Use PGP and locally saved signature files to automate auth process.
  - Automate an otherwise tedious and time consuming process (e.g entering
   & re-entering your password)
