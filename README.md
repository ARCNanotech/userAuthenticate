Node Module for UserAuth in web apps
  This package uses the [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) technology and 
   concurrent stream processing architecture, originally developed by 
  [Arcware](https://arcware.com) In implementing the formal programming
  standard for network switches , make it possible for [Combinatorial optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics#Combinatorial_Optimization),
  and other devices that require fast translation of big-data sets.
  
  - Applying the dynamic platform of, buffer-targeted elements,
  This vector can implement a variety of tools for interacting,
  with static objects.
  
  - Define the mathematical properties of each object in detail,
  sufficient for a reader to create a mental image. Yet sophisticated,
  enough to be accepted.

#Usage

Install this globally and you'll have access to the <code>userAuth</code> command from any part of
your system.
 
 <code>npm install -g userAuth</code>
  
  This module uses a dynamic circular buffer system where there is,
  a set of accepted commands to the interpreter. These are standard,
  linux type commands.

Config
======
 Use the userauthenticate library and the call functions to or from it in your
 projects using this or similar implementation.

````javascript
  var userauth = require('userauth');
    var authlib = require('userauth.lib');
```
   
   **Exceptions**
   Compare or contrast the the type or rank of functions subgrouped from the
   source library. You can pull the components of each subclass of this source
   using the <code>GET</code> operator 
   
```javascript
...
  int q = Object.create ()
  for(int i = 100; i < q; i++)
    insertElementat[[ exception (e) ]];
    for i + q = Object.Stream(create(Emlementbyid b'bytes':*
  return (q + '\' or ';' or '\\' \
  + 'The stream reports the bytes of stream created:' \
  +  ';' + i )
```

To add some [synctactic magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_expletive] in
projects with this module.
  
      nodejs userAuth/userAuth.cpl
      
Suppose you wish to list the most recent connect logs, use the <code>log</code> command.

      nodejs userAuth --log recent
      
However you can omit the <code>nodejs</code> flag to run the userAuth module independently
of the Bower/NPM platform.
      
  **Example**
  <code>userAuth [cmd(s)] [opt(s)] </code>
   
                  Commands:
  **GET Command**
  
  <code> get - The standard get request. Requires a HTTP(S) target </code>
            <code>(**e.x** userAuth get https://ha.ckme.com)</code> 
            
Key:
``` UNIX-bash
  GET
```

Key Value:
```UNIX-bash
String, List, Array
```

  **ls Command**
  <code>ls - List all files and folders within the current directory</code>.
  if None is specified.
            
  **SET Command**  
  
  ``` UNIX-bash
  SET - Set a variable, this can either be global or local
 ````
          This command can define any range of variables from programming
          implements, to Database variables. The Syntax is as follows:
        

  Key: 
  ``` UNIX-bash
  SET
  ````
  
  Key Value 
  ```UNIX-bash
  String, Integer
  ```
          
  When you have a specific global constant that needs to be set,
  a command can be formed in the format:
          
 <code>set VARIABLE=value</code>
 <code>(**e.x** userAuth set var=1)</code>
  
<<< Templates:

Examples
========
  Here is a simple example in ruby module that invokes
  the target userAuth
  
```ruby 
  for (each userauth(Module): ifExists) {
    if != Module.aspx.Definition();
      Module = [$MODULE_REF_LOG != USERAUTH_RUBY_VERSION '2.3'];
      FOR 
    }
```
###Cross-Platform
Use this to enable Linux functionality for userAuth, add one of the following to your
<code>~/.bashrc</code> or <code>~/.zshrc</code> file.

#### Mac OS/ iOS Ports
======================
Development has begun on an iOS oriented port of this application. Release dates of 
Ma, Unix, windows ports will be synchronous.

      **Notable Features in Mac Version**
- Each individual function of Mac OS differs from each individual of Windows and Linux      
<<<<<<< HEAD
 - Entirely new source code anf cunctionality will be built into iOS future ports.
 - To include modular capabilities in Cross-Platform solutions of this source
=======

>>>>>>>  Update network configuration
 
  (~~Apply cryptographic method of encryption accross all user data types~~)
  - Use PGP and locally saved signature files to automate auth process.
  - Automate an otherwise tedious and time consuming process (e.g entering
   & re-entering your password)
  - A cross-platform implement utilising code shared between platforms.
  
**C#**
The cross-platform solution is coded primarily in C#. With a backend of
Ruby Platform that integrates a highly sophisticated network infrastructure.
