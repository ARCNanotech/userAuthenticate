=======


Node Module for UserAuth in web apps
  This package uses the [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) technology and 
   concurrent stream processing architecture, originally developed by 
  [Arcware](https://arcware.com) In implementing the formal programming
  standard for network switches , make it possible for [Combinatorial optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics#Combinatorial_Optimization),
  and other devices that require fast translation of big-data sets.
  
  - Applying the dynamic platform of, buffer-targeted elements,
  This vector can implement a variety of tools for interacting,
  with static objects.
  
  - Define the mathematical properties of each object in detail,
  sufficient for a reader to create a mental image. Yet sophisticated,
  enough to be accepted.

#Usage

Install this globally and you'll have access to the <code>userAuth</code> command from any part of
your system.
 
 <code>npm install -g userAuth</code>
  
  This module uses a dynamic circular buffer system where there is,
  a set of accepted commands to the interpreter. These are standard,
  linux type commands.
  
** Basic Scipting **
***
Consider the follwing basic bash script:
``` bash
ls -a
git status -sb
git checkout master
./build
cd binary ^
./makefile
else `
chown 65331 binary/makefile.js
./binary/makefile
```

The precding(above) script executes the following commands 
[PREORDER]
- 1.LIST: list the contents of current directory and append
   - 2. GIT: check the status of current repository, showing commit attribute
   - 3. GIT: Compare the current and master branch to determine if there are differences that could be overritted.
      - 4. Linux/Bash: Build current package [userAuth-v1.0.9] *Note*: Accepts No Arguments
      - 5. Linux/Bash: Run the makefile used to finalize the build\install process. Usually located in "app__root/binary"
      - 6.Linux/Bash: Add ownership privileges to property of referenced file. [/binary/makefile.js]
         - 7. CMD: Enter the referenced diredtory [binary]
         - 8. charAt(14,11): The '^' character is used in Win PS to indicate an additional line of input.
            - 9.ELSE: Standard `else` operator, notable in many programming languages and protocols.
                 - 10. FINALLY: Run the compiled Makedile; from app_root_dir

Config
======
 Use the userauthenticate library and the call functions to or from it in your
 projects using this or similar implementation.

````javascript
  var userauth = require('userauth');
    var authlib = require('userauth.lib');
```
   
   **Exceptions**
   Compare or contrast the the type or rank of functions subgrouped from the
   source library. You can pull the components of each subclass of this source
   using the <code>GET</code> operator 
   
```javascript
...
  int q = Object.create ()
  for(int i = 100; i < q; i++)
    insertElementat[[ exception (e) ]];
    for i + q = Object.Stream(create(Emlementbyid b'bytes':*
  return (q + '\' or ';' or '\\' \
  + 'The stream reports the bytes of stream created:' \
  +  ';' + i )
```

Distributed BreakPoints
=======================
***
In some sample projects you might consider adding a set breakpoints.
e.g(insert at--> charAt(x, y , z). As the vector insertion can be 
easily set, simply modify the co-ordinates. As:

``` javascript
string var = Object.value('_int_');
  mode.Constant = system.call_constructor(param: value, static: false, latency: none)
    if () [[target.value != null and if latency is not > 0.1]] 
    {
    }
```

To add some [synctactic magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_expletive] in
projects with this module.
  
      nodejs userAuth/userAuth.cpl
      
Suppose you wish to list the most recent connect logs, use the <code>log</code> command.

      nodejs userAuth --log recent
      
API Keys and Commands
=====================
<code>keys</code> will be herein refrred to as global string objects that when called
upon execute a system command from the internal CLI libraries. The Input of the object
can consist of usual operators e.g[ ('~') 
                                      - To infer approximation
                                   ('~>')
                                      - To approximate branch value if newer version exists
                                      upstream
                                   ('^')
                                      - 
      
However you can omit the <code>nodejs</code> flag to run the userAuth module independently
of the Bower/NPM platform.
      
  **Example**
  <code>userAuth [cmd(s)] [opt(s)] </code>e
   
                  Commands:
  **GET Command**
  
  <code> get - The standard get request. Requires a HTTP(S) target </code>
            <code>(**e.x** userAuth get https://ha.ckme.com)</code> 
            
Key:
``` UNIX-bash
  GET
```

Key Value:
```UNIX-bash
String, List, Array
```

  **ls Command**
  <code>ls - List all files and folders within the current directory</code>.
  if None is specified.
            
  **SET Command**  
  
  ``` UNIX-bash
  SET - Set a variable, this can either be global or local
 ````
          This command can define any range of variables from programming
          implements, to Database variables. The Syntax is as follows:
        

  Key: 
  ``` UNIX-bash
  SET
  ````
  
  Key Value 
  ```UNIX-bash
  String, Integer
  ```
          
  When you have a specific global constant that needs to be set,
  a command can be formed in the format:
          
 <code>set VARIABLE=value</code>
 <code>(**e.x** userAuth set var=1)</code>
  
<<< Templates:

Examples
========
  Here is a simple example in ruby module that invokes
  the target userAuth
  
```ruby 
  for (each userauth(Module): ifExists) {
    if != Module.aspx.Definition();
      Module = [$MODULE_REF_LOG != USERAUTH_RUBY_VERSION '2.3'];
      FOR 
    }
```
###Cross-Platform
Use this to enable Linux functionality for userAuth, add one of the following to your
<code>~/.bashrc</code> or <code>~/.zshrc</code> file.

#### Mac OS/ iOS Ports
======================
Development has begun on an iOS oriented port of this application. Release dates of 
Ma, Unix, windows ports will be synchronous.

      **Notable Features in Mac Version**
- Each individual function of Mac OS differs from each individual of Windows and Linux      
<<<<<<< HEAD
 - Entirely new source code anf cunctionality will be built into iOS future ports.
 - To include modular capabilities in Cross-Platform solutions of this source
=======

>>>>>>>  Update network configuration
 
  (~~Apply cryptographic method of encryption accross all user data types~~)
  - Use PGP and locally saved signature files to automate auth process.
  - Automate an otherwise tedious and time consuming process (e.g entering
   & re-entering your password)
  - A cross-platform implement utilising code shared between platforms.
  
**C#**
The cross-platform solution is coded primarily in C#. With a backend of
**Ruby**
Ruby Platform that integrates a highly sophisticated network infrastructure. 

WHen we developed the backend in Ruby we wanted to ensure that its structure
could be easily replicated, more so for the insurance of code-reuse. As to 
develop an individual application framework for each platform e.g(Mac, Windows, iOS)
would be 3x as expensive. Compared to a single cross platform solution that can 
simoultaneously target eash operating system.
