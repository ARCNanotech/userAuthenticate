Node Module for UserAuth in web apps
  This package uses the node infrastructure, for
  creating highly scalable network platforms. 
  
  - Applying the dynamic platform of, buffer-targeted elements,
  This vector can implement a variety of tools for interacting,
  with static objects.
  
  - Define the mathematical properties of each object in detail,
  sufficient for a reader to create a mental image. Yet sophisticated,
  enough to be accepted. 

#Usage
 
 <code>npm install -g userAuth</code>
  
  This module uses a dynamic circular buffer system where there is,
  a set of accepted commands to the interpreter. These are standard,
  linux type commands.
  
  **Example**
  <code>userAuth [cmd(s)] [opt(s)] </code>
  
  Commands: <code> get - The standard get request. Requires a HTTP(S) target</code>
            <code>(**e.x** userAuth get https://ha.ckme.com) 
            
            <code> set - Set a variable, this can wither be global or local </code>
